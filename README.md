# ðŸŸ¢ Subscription Analytics Tool
A Python-based CRUD program designed as a case study simulating the management and analytics for a mock subscription-based service. This program replicates how administrators can manage user records and derive analysis from subscriber data.

## Project Overview
Provides a simplified demonstration of how subsciption-based businesses might manage and analyze their customer data and acquire insights.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and delete users to and from the database
- **Subscription Management:** Track subscription history, manage plan, start/stop dates, and user data.
- **Insights & Reports:** Report key subscription metrics such as churn rate, CLV, MRR, and acquisition channels.

Since their IT infrastructures aren't fully set up yet, **the customer and product team** requires a tool to manage all subscriptions and generate reports up until **January 1st, 2026**.
