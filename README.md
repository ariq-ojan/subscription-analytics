# 🟢 Subscription Analytics Tool
A Python-based CRUD program designed as a case study simulating the management and analytics for a mock subscription-based service. This program replicates how administrators can manage user records and derive analysis from subscriber data.

## Project Overview
Provides a simplified demonstration of how subsciption-based businesses might manage and analyze their customer data and acquire insights.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and delete users to and from the database
- **Subscription Management:** Track subscription history, manage plan, start/stop dates, and user data.
- **Insights & Reports:** Report key subscription metrics such as churn rate, CLV, MRR, and acquisition channels.

</div>

Sporkify is a recently launched subscription-based music streaming platform catered to music enthusiasts. They promotes sustainable business practices in the music industry, ensuring artists and musicians are paid faiarly.

Since their IT infrastructures aren't fully set up yet, **the customer and product team** requires a tool to manage all subscriptions and generate simple reports up until **January 1st, 2026**.

## Limitations
- Program is restricted to the year of 2025, current time is **frozen at December 31st, 2025.**
- As a mockup, this program does not have any memory, any changes made to the database **will be lost after exit.**

## User Data Structure
```python
  {
    "1": {                             # user_id and key of the dictionary
    "name": "Ali Susanto",             # Username
    "acq_channel": "Referral",         # Acquisition channel (Referral/Ads/Organic)
    "subscriptions": [                 # List of subs stored in a dictionary
        {"plan": "Basic",              # Available plans (Basic/Pro/Ultimate)
         "start_date": "2025-01-01",
         "end_date": "2025-06-30",
         "status": "Inactive"},        # Status of subscription (Active/Inactive)
        {"plan": "Pro",               
         "start_date": "2025-07-01",
         "end_date": None,        
         "status": "Active"}
        ]
    }  
  ```
The program contains **10 hard-coded existing subscribers data**. New users can be added using the "Add New User" menu.
